 I was tasked with analyzing Diwali sales data to improve our company's sales and customer experience. The data consisted of sales records spanning various product categories and customer information, including states, occupations, gender, and age groups. The goal was to gain insights to enhance our sales strategies and customer engagement during the Diwali season.

 My primary responsibility was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Specifically, I needed to clean and manipulate the data, visualize it, and extract meaningful insights to guide our business decisions for the upcoming Diwali sales season.

Data Cleaning and Manipulation: I began by cleaning the raw sales data, which involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies. Then, I manipulated the data to organize it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I conducted in-depth EDA. I generated various visualizations, including bar plots, scatterplots, and histograms, to explore the data's characteristics and uncover trends.

Customer Segmentation: I segmented our customer base based on different criteria, including states, occupations, gender, and age groups. This segmentation allowed us to tailor our marketing and sales strategies to target specific customer segments effectively.

Product Analysis: I identified the most selling product categories and individual products by analyzing sales data. This information helped us plan inventory and ensure we could meet customer demand during the Diwali season

We improved the customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups, allowing us to create personalized marketing campaigns.

Sales were enhanced through the identification of the most selling product categories and products, enabling better inventory planning and demand fulfillment.
